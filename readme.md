# 3D Printing BG3 Minifigures

Work in progress.
Only tested for Windows 10.

This guide will assume that you have Baldur's Gate 3 and Blender installed.
Further, basic knowledge of using Blender is expected.

If you do print the model by yourself at home, you will also need a 3D printer, and it's slicing software.

You should be warned that following this guide through to a printed model is neither easy nor quick.
Figuring out these steps took me well over 20 hours the first time, I will update this how long it takes me on my second go when I'm done with it.

## Obtaining the 3D Model

## Print preparation in Blender
